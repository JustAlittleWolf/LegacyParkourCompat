# F015: Ground drag resamples support after movement

1.13.2, ornithe-feather: `1.13.2/ornithe-feather/net/minecraft/entity/living/LivingEntity.java`, `moveRelative`, lines 1538–1558.
1.14.4, ornithe-feather: `1.14.4/ornithe-feather/net/minecraft/entity/living/LivingEntity.java`, `moveRelative`, lines 1840–1866.

Difference: In 1.13.2's ordinary non-fluid, non-fall-flying branch, the block below the player's shape is sampled before movement to compute the ground acceleration. After `move`, 1.13.2 resets the drag coefficient from `0.91F`, rechecks `onGround`, and, if still grounded, reads slipperiness at the player's new position before multiplying horizontal velocity by the resulting value. 1.14.4 captures `onGround ? slipperiness * 0.91F : 0.91F` before movement in `w`, then uses that same `w` after movement. 1.14.4 therefore does not resample support state or the block below the resulting position for this drag step.

Movement meaning: The difference is reachable in ordinary land travel when the player crosses a support boundary or moves onto a block with a different slipperiness during the move.
